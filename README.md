**Overview**
Welcome to the Power BI Sales Dashboard repository! This project aims to provide valuable insights into sales performance metrics through interactive visualizations created using Power BI.

**Sales Trend Over Time**
Visualize the trend of Total Sales, Gross Sales, and Net Sales over time using line charts or area charts. This provides an overview of how sales have been performing over a specific period.

**Comparison by Product**
Include a bar chart or table showing Total Sales by Product. Highlight top-selling products or product categories to identify where sales are strongest.

**Comparison by Country**
Display Total Sales by Country using a bar chart or table. Identify regions or countries with the highest sales contribution to understand geographical performance.

**Comparison by Discount Band**
Show Total Sales by Discount Band using a bar chart or table. Analyze the impact of discounts on sales and identify which discount bands are most effective.

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**
Include KPI cards or a summary table displaying:
**Total Sales:** The total revenue generated from sales transactions.
**Sum of Gross Sales:** The total revenue generated from sales before any deductions.
**Sum of Profit:** The net profit or earnings generated by the business after deducting all expenses from revenue.

These KPIs provide quick insights into overall sales performance.

**DAX Calculations and Measures**
The Power BI Sales Dashboard project utilizes Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to perform calculations and create measures that drive the analysis of sales performance metrics. Key DAX calculations include aggregating total sales, gross sales, and profit across various dimensions such as time, product, country, and discount band. Measures are created to calculate important KPIs such as average sales, total units sold, and total revenue. Additionally, transformations are applied to the raw data to prepare it for analysis, including filtering, grouping, and deriving new calculated columns. These DAX calculations, measures, and transformations are essential in providing meaningful insights and enabling dynamic analysis within the Power BI dashboard.

**Interactivity and Filters**
Incorporate slicers or filters to allow users to dynamically filter the data by product, country, or discount band. This enables users to drill down into specific segments and analyze sales performance in more detail.
